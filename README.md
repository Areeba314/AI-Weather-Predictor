# AI Weather Predictor

## Overview
The **AI Weather Predictor** is a Python-based application that forecasts weather conditions using various machine learning models. Users can select a specific model from a dropdown menu to generate predictions for temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, the application allows users to compare predictions from all models using a bar graph for better analysis.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Extracts weather data from a text file.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **SVM Model**: A supervised learning model used for regression tasks.
  - **ARIMA Model**: A time series forecasting model for analyzing temporal data.
  - **Gradient Boosting Model**: An ensemble learning method for regression tasks.
  - **K-NN Model**: A non-parametric method used for regression.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built using `tkinter` for easy interaction.
- **Visualization**: Displays weather predictions using bar graphs.
- **Model Comparison**: Compares the performance of all models using a grouped bar graph.
